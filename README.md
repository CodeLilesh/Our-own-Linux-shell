## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC Compiler
- readline Library (for command line editing)

### Building the Shell

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd shell-project
   ```

3. Build the shell:

   ```bash
   gcc -o myshell shell.c -lreadline
   ```

## Usage

Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./myshell
```

Now you can use the shell to execute commands.
